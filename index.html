         <p>Hey, my name is Garrett Griffin and I am student of the KU
             Coding Bootcamp. I'm currently enrolled in the fullstack 
             development course and will be showcasing my classwork and
             independent projects in this portfolio, so check back in to
             see my progress over the next few months.
         </p>
         <p>When not programming, I generally spend my time with my wife,
             Sophia, and my pug, Jack Danger. Lately, it's been brutally
             cold in my hometown of Kansas City, but during the nicer parts
             of the year, I spend a lot of time playing disc golf. Kansas 
             City has some amazing disc golf locations, but one of my favorite
             past times is traveling around the country to play a wide 
             variety of courses. 
         </p>
         <p>Sophia and I also take a lot of trips camping and hiking. We have
             quite a few local parks that we like to go to, and we've been lucky
             enough to take several larger trips to state and national parks all over
             the U.S. 
         </p>
         <p>
            Thanks for checking out my work! I'm very excited to keep learning
            and will update when I have more!
