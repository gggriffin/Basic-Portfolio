         <p>Hey, my name is Garrett Griffin and I'm currently
            writing words in order to take up space. I know
            I can just copy/paste filler text from lipsum.com
            but I also need to better understand how the formatting
            will work for text that I include in the future. For 
            example, I am currently hitting enter every time
            the text starts to go out of view of my window in VS
            Code.
         </p>
         <p>I went ahead and switched to a seperate paragraph tag.
            I'm going to see how this paragraph differs from the 
            first paragraph here in just a second. Spoiler alert,
            I'll probably start a third one as well.
         </p>
         <p>Yeah, I went ahead and did that and this is what it looks
            like. Cool cool cool.
